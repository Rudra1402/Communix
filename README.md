## Communix - Social Media App

Note: This app is using several free hosting services which makes it a bit slow because of less scalable servers (Majorly impacted by PostgreSQL: hosted on ElephantSQL)
If anyone has any idea of free hosting service for PostgreSQL database, then please let me know. Thanks!

Soon, I will change the database from PostgreSQL to MongoDB.
